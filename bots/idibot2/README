ideas:
have each ant control itself
- still pretty simple compared to forming plans involving many ants

all pairs shortest path
- help ants navigate to objectives
- objectives become more important the closer they are to your hill
- objectives become more important the closer the ant is to it

objectives:
- unknown space - maximize vision of map
- food
  - less important when lots of ants queued
- hills
- enemy ants
  - attacking - record each ant's desire to attack, but have it wait until the trade is worthwhile
  - enemy ants should be impassible (in some range?) for pathing unless attacking
- maintain path back to home
- not crowding, spreading out
- assignment to objectives
