idibot1 implements the following strategies:
- Go toward food
- Go away from friendly ants
- Go away from own hill
- Go toward enemy hills

These are implemented so that the heuristic becomes stronger as the ant gets closer to the target.
Selection of moves is ultimately a weighted random selection of all possible moves.
This ensures ants don't become permanently stuck.
